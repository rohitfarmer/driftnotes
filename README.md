# DriftNotes: A lightweight journaling engine for thoughts that drift between tweets and blogs.

DriftNotes is a minimal static site generator for short-form, everyday journaling. Write Markdown entries grouped by year and month, and DriftNotes compiles them into clean, fast, fully static HTML—complete with tags, permalinks, dark mode, on-this-day pages, and offline search. Perfect for writing posts that are more meaningful than a tweet but less formal than a full blog post.
